# Templates for personal Website
* IMPORTANT NOTE: This website (html/css/js) is built on top of existing templates to host portfolio.
* If you care about how I've modified these templates here's links to the original works:
- For my resume: (https://blackrockdigital.github.io/startbootstrap-resume/)
- For the main portfolio site: (https://blackrockdigital.github.io/startbootstrap-stylish-portfolio/)
- For my loan planner: (https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.1/examples/checkout/)

Although I have done a lot of work modifying this site, and modifying the file
structure along with some code and style. A better display of my skill set lays
in the items in the portfolio.
